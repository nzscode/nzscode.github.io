                        Jasmine, (genus Jasminum), genus of about 200 species of
                        fragrant-flowered shrubs and vines of the olive family
                        (Oleaceae). The plants are native to tropical and to
                        some temperate areas of the Old World. Several are
                        cultivated as ornamentals. Most true jasmines have
                        climbing branches without tendrils.

                    <p>
                        Lily of the valley, (Convallaria majalis), fragrant
                        perennial herb and only species of the genus Convallaria
                        in the asparagus family (Asparagaceae). Native to
                        Eurasia and eastern North America, lily of the valley is
                        cultivated in shaded garden areas in many temperate
                        parts of the world. The plants often grow closely
                        together, forming a dense mat, and are sometimes used as
                        ground cover.

                        Hyacinth, (genus Hyacinthus), small genus of bulbous
                        herbs (family Asparagaceae, formerly Hyacinthaceae),
                        native primarily to the Mediterranean region and
                        tropical Africa. The common garden hyacinths are derived
                        from Hyacinthus orientalis and are popular spring
                        ornamentals.
